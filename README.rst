*Traderbot is a tool for Traders*
~~~~~~~~~


About
~~~~~~
The purpose of this project is to create trading bots that can profit from
volatility within cryptocurrency markets, and to support contributors
with code that can grow and secure their own financial wealth. 

Furthermore, the goal of this GitHub Repo is to build and foster an open source 
community of developers and traders who can benefit and contribute to making 
this project stronger.
